# Task Countdown Page

## Steps

1. Fork or download this project (please don't make any references to Square Enix if you create your own project on public GitHub)
2. Open the PSD file named `countdown.psd` located in the `design` folder (if you don't have Photoshop you can use an online editor like https://www.photopea.com/)
3. Don't use the fonts that are in the PSD; just use standard system fonts or try and find suitable open sourced replacements
4. Implement the design using a frontend Library or Framework
5. Add instructions on how to build
6. Send us the source code of the finished project

## Required implementation

- The countdown can point to any date in the future, however this date should be easy for us to change so we can assess your work
- Join and Login buttons should point to http://square-enix-games.com
- The calendar button should add an event to a google calendar
- Newsletter sign up should link to https://square-enix-games.com/

## Extra points

- Usage server side rendering
- Page refreshes when countdown reaches 00:00:00:00
- Page interactions
- Usage of git and multiple small commits
- Snapshots using jest
